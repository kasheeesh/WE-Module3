# WE Assignment 5

Hi! Today we will be playing the game of diamonds!

ChatGPT

**ChatGPT**

That sounds intriguing! How do we play the game of diamonds?

[https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AEdFTp5eY1pEt9nvCbIj1MqDkrn9Kqjj814EjYIf_TZU=s96-c](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AEdFTp5eY1pEt9nvCbIj1MqDkrn9Kqjj814EjYIf_TZU=s96-c)

**You**

It is a card game in which all diamonds are set aside in a pile, faced down. Every other suit, in this case spade, hearts and clubs are distributed to the players, playing the game. Each player gets one suit out of spades, clubs and hearts.

ChatGPT

**ChatGPT**

Got it! So, each player receives one suit out of spades, clubs, and hearts. What's the objective of the game?

[https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AEdFTp5eY1pEt9nvCbIj1MqDkrn9Kqjj814EjYIf_TZU=s96-c](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AEdFTp5eY1pEt9nvCbIj1MqDkrn9Kqjj814EjYIf_TZU=s96-c)

**You**

In this game, spades, hearts and clubs are equal and the objective of the game is to bid the highest. The person with the highest bid takes away the prize (which in this case will be a random card of diamonds picked up from the pile set aside.) If two players have the highest bid, the prize points will then be divided. Should i also explain you the gameplay with an example?

ChatGPT

**ChatGPT**

Yes, please! An example would be helpful to understand the gameplay better.

[https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AEdFTp5eY1pEt9nvCbIj1MqDkrn9Kqjj814EjYIf_TZU=s96-c](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AEdFTp5eY1pEt9nvCbIj1MqDkrn9Kqjj814EjYIf_TZU=s96-c)

**You**

For example, 3 players, player1, player2 and player3 are playing this game. All the diamonds have been set aside in a pile, shuffled and are kept facing down. Each player gets a suit. player1 gets spade. player2 gets hearts and player3 gets clubs. A card is drawn from the diamond pile, suppose the 5 of diamonds, which in this case is the prize. Now all the players will secretly bid a card, which will be unknown to the other players. For example player1 bids the 6 of spades, player2 bids the 3 of hearts and player3 bids the 8 of clubs. Now all the bids will be revealed. The player with the highest bid, in this case player3(with the 8 of clubs) will win. Thus player 3 will win the 5 of diamonds card, earning 5 points.

ChatGPT

**ChatGPT**

Got it! It's a bidding game where each player secretly bids a card from their suit, and the player with the highest bid wins the prize card (a diamond) from the pile. Points are awarded based on the value of the diamond card won. Thanks for the explanation! Let's play!

[https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AEdFTp5eY1pEt9nvCbIj1MqDkrn9Kqjj814EjYIf_TZU=s96-c](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AEdFTp5eY1pEt9nvCbIj1MqDkrn9Kqjj814EjYIf_TZU=s96-c)

**You**

if you and i are going to play, we will be playing with the diamonds set aside as the prizes. You will get the heart suit, i will get the club suit and we will discard all the spades, since only two players are playing the game.

ChatGPT

**ChatGPT**

Understood! So, you'll have the club suit, and I'll have the heart suit, and we'll be competing for the diamond prizes. Let's begin!

[https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AEdFTp5eY1pEt9nvCbIj1MqDkrn9Kqjj814EjYIf_TZU=s96-c](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AEdFTp5eY1pEt9nvCbIj1MqDkrn9Kqjj814EjYIf_TZU=s96-c)

**You**

Also, just clarifying if both of us have the same bid, the prize points will be divided.

ChatGPT

**ChatGPT**

Got it! If we both have the same bid, we'll split the points for the prize. Let's proceed with our bids.

[https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AEdFTp5eY1pEt9nvCbIj1MqDkrn9Kqjj814EjYIf_TZU=s96-c](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AEdFTp5eY1pEt9nvCbIj1MqDkrn9Kqjj814EjYIf_TZU=s96-c)

**You**

if we play this i want you to draw a random diamond card which will be the prize. Then i want you to bid secretly and so will i. Then we shall reveal our bids. Whoever has the highest bid, wins. I also want you to keep a track of our scores.

ChatGPT

**ChatGPT**

Alright, let's do it! I'll draw a random diamond card to be the prize, and then we'll each make a secret bid. After revealing our bids, I'll keep track of our scores.

This code allows the user to play the diamonds game against a bot. The bot's bids are randomly generated, and the user can input their bids. The winner of each round is determined based on the bids made and the values of the diamond cards. Finally, the total points for each player are calculated, and the winner of the game is declared.

in the draw_ card function you can make sure that once a card has been drawn it wouldnt be repeated.

ChatGPT

**ChatGPT**

You're absolutely right! We can modify the **`draw_card`** function to ensure that once a card has been drawn, it won't be repeated. We can achieve this by using a list to keep track of the cards that have already been drawn. Here's the modified code:

```python
pythonCopy code

    diamonds = ['2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A']
    available_cards = [card for card in diamonds if card not in drawn_cards]
    if available_cards:
        card = random.choice(available_cards)
        drawn_cards.append(card)
        return card
    else:
        print("No more cards left!")
        return None

# Function to make the bot's bid
def make_bid():
    clubs = ['2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A']
    return random.choice(clubs)

# Function to compare bids and determine the winner
def compare_bids(user_bid, bot_bid):
    diamonds_values = {'2': 2, '3': 3, '4': 4, '5': 5, '6': 6, '7': 7, '8': 8, '9': 9, '10': 10, 'J': 11, 'Q': 12, 'K': 13, 'A': 14}
    if diamonds_values[user_bid] > diamonds_values[bot_bid]:
        return "user"
    elif diamonds_values[user_bid] < diamonds_values[bot_bid]:
        return "bot"
    else:
        return "tie"

# Function to play the game
def play_game():
    user_points = 0
    bot_points = 0
    rounds = 5
    drawn_cards = []

    print("Let's play the Diamonds game!")

    for round in range(rounds):
        print(f"\nRound {round + 1}:")

        # Draw a random diamond card
        prize_card = draw_card(drawn_cards)
        if not prize_card:
            break  # Exit the loop if no cards left
        print(f"The prize card for this round is the {prize_card} of diamonds.")

        # User makes a bid
        user_bid = input("Make your bid (2-10, J, Q, K, A): ")

        # Bot makes a bid
        bot_bid = make_bid()
        print(f"The bot bids: {bot_bid}")

        # Compare bids to determine the winner
        winner = compare_bids(user_bid, bot_bid)

        if winner == "user":
            print("You win this round!")
            user_points += int(prize_card)
        elif winner == "bot":
            print("The bot wins this round!")
            bot_points += int(prize_card)
        else:

```

In this modified version, the **`draw_card`** function takes a list of **`drawn_cards`** as an argument, which keeps track of the cards that have already been drawn. It ensures that only cards that haven't been drawn yet are available for selection. If no cards are left, it prints a message and returns **`None`**, indicating that no more cards are available.

Once the bot has bid a card, it shouldnt be able to bid that card again and the same goes for the user. The bot should track the cards bid by it, so it doesnt repeat and should also track the cards users have bid. Once bid if the user bids them again the bot should ask them to bid another.

Also make sure there are 13 rounds since, the diamond suit will have 13 cards to pick from. After 13 rounds the game will end the the bot should reveal the winner.

**ChatGPT**

Got it! I'll make the necessary adjustments to ensure that neither the bot nor the user can bid the same card twice during the game. Additionally, I'll set the number of rounds to 13 and ensure that the game ends after these rounds, revealing the winner. Here's the updated code:

```python

    if available_bids:
        bid = random.choice(available_bids)

        # Draw a random diamond card
        prize_card = draw_card(drawn_cards)
        if not prize_card:
            break  # Exit the loop if no cards left
        print(f"The prize card for this round is the {prize_card} of diamonds.")

        # User makes a bid

        print(f"The bot bids: {bot_bid}")

        # Compare bids to determine the winner
        if user_bid > bot_bid:
            print("You win this round!")
            user_points += int(prize_card)
        elif user_bid < bot_bid:
            print("The bot wins this round!")

    else:
        print("It's a tie!")

# Call the function to start the game

```

In this version, I've added tracking for the bids made by both the user and the bot to ensure that no card can be bid twice by either party. Additionally, I've set the number of rounds to 13 and adjusted the game logic to end after these rounds, revealing the winner based on the total points earned.

Now, even if the bot doesn't have any available bids left, it will randomly pick a card to bid from all available cards. This should resolve the error you encountered.

since you are tracking the cards the user has used, in some way is it possible to develop a strategy so that the bot always wins?

ChatGPT

**ChatGPT**

Developing a strategy for the bot to always win in a game like this can be challenging, especially considering the randomness involved in drawing cards and making bids. However, we can certainly try to devise a strategy that increases the bot's chances of winning. Here are a few possible strategies the bot could employ:

1. **Track User Bids**: The bot can track the cards the user has bid and adjust its own bids accordingly. For example, if the user consistently bids high-value cards early in the game, the bot can adjust by bidding even higher-value cards to secure wins.
2. **Predict User Bids**: Analyze the user's bidding patterns and attempt to predict their next move based on past behavior. This could involve identifying tendencies such as consistently bidding the highest or lowest available card, and adjusting the bot's bids accordingly to counteract or take advantage of these patterns.
3. **Control the Game Pace**: By strategically bidding high or low on certain rounds, the bot can influence the pace and direction of the game. For instance, if the bot is leading in points, it may choose to bid low to prolong the game and increase its lead. Conversely, if the bot is behind, it may bid aggressively to catch up.
4. **Bluffing**: Introduce an element of bluffing by occasionally bidding unexpectedly high or low, regardless of the bot's actual hand strength. This can potentially confuse the user and lead them to make suboptimal bids.
5. **Adapt to Game State**: Continuously assess the current state of the game, including the number of rounds remaining, the points differential between the bot and the user, and the cards already drawn. Based on this information, the bot can dynamically adjust its bidding strategy to maximize its chances of winning.

Implementing these strategies would require a more sophisticated decision-making algorithm for the bot, potentially involving machine learning techniques or heuristic-based approaches. While it's challenging to guarantee that the bot will always win, employing these strategies can certainly increase its competitiveness and overall success rate.

**You**

can you implement any strategy in the code which will help the bot win the game

ChatGPT

**ChatGPT**

Sure, let's implement a basic strategy where the bot tracks the user's bids and adjusts its own bids accordingly. In this strategy, if the user consistently bids high-value cards, the bot will aim to bid even higher-value cards to secure wins. If the user bids low-value cards, the bot will try to win with lower-value cards, conserving higher-value cards for later rounds.

Here's how we can modify the code to implement this strategy:

```python
pythonCopy code

        print("Sorry! The bot wins!")
    else:
        print("It's a tie!")

# Call the function to start the game

```

In this modified code, the **`make_bot_bid`** function implements the strategy for the bot. It analyzes the user's bids and adjusts its own bids accordingly to increase its chances of winning.

In this strategy, the bot evaluates the drawn card and adjusts its bid accordingly. It will bid lower for low-value cards, higher for medium-value cards, and even higher for high-value cards, aiming to secure more wins based on the drawn card's value. Additionally, it also considers the user's bidding patterns to adjust its own bidding strategy, increasing its chances of winning.

It seems there's an issue with the bot's bidding logic when all of its previous bids are high-value cards. Let me address this and make sure the bot adjusts its bidding strategy correctly.

I've identified the issue in the bot's bidding logic when all of its previous bids are high-value cards. Let's fix this by handling the case where there are no low-value bids made by the bot yet. Here's the corrected code:

Now, the bot's bidding logic should work correctly even when all its previous bids are high-value cards. Let's play the Diamonds game and see how it performs!

**You**

This strategy is creating a problem. The bot will bid one card more than once, since no track of available bids is being made

From this remove the strategy which depends on the users previous cards and the bot only makes the bid based on the diamond card generated.

Got it. Let's simplify the bot's bidding strategy to only consider the value of the drawn diamond card and make its bid accordingly. Here's the modified code without the strategy based on the user's previous bids:

```python
pythonCopy code
import random

# Dictionary to store the points for each card
card_points = {'2': 2, '3': 3, '4': 4, '5': 5, '6': 6, '7': 7, '8': 8, '9': 9, '10': 10, 'J': 11, 'Q': 12, 'K': 13, 'A': 14}

# Function to draw a random diamond card
def draw_card(drawn_cards):
    diamonds = ['2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A']
    available_cards = [card for card in diamonds if card not in drawn_cards]
    if available_cards:
        card = random.choice(available_cards)
        drawn_cards.append(card)
        return card
    else:
        print("No more cards left!")
        return None

# Function for user to make a bid
def user_bid(user_bids):
    bid = input("Make your bid (2-10, J, Q, K, A): ")
    while bid in user_bids:
        print("You've already bid that card. Please choose another.")
        bid = input("Make your bid (2-10, J, Q, K, A): ")
    user_bids.append(bid)
    return bid

# Function to make the bot's bid based on the drawn card
def make_bot_bid(drawn_card):
    clubs = ['2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A']

    # Adjust bot's bid based on drawn card value
    if drawn_card in ['2', '3', '4', '5', '6']:
        bot_bid = random.choice(['2', '3', '4', '5', '6'])
    elif drawn_card in ['7', '8', '9']:
        bot_bid = random.choice(['7', '8', '9'])
    else:  # drawn_card in ['10', 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A']
        bot_bid = random.choice(['10', 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A'])

    return bot_bid

# Function to determine the winner of the round
def determine_winner(user_bid, bot_bid, prize_card):
    if card_points[user_bid] > card_points[bot_bid]:
        return "user"
    elif card_points[user_bid] < card_points[bot_bid]:
        return "bot"
    else:
        return "tie"

# Function to play the game
def play_game():
    user_points = 0
    bot_points = 0
    rounds = 13
    user_bids = []
    bot_bids = []
    drawn_cards = []

    print("Let's play the Diamonds game!")

    for round_num in range(1, rounds + 1):
        print(f"\nRound {round_num}:")

        # Draw a random diamond card
        prize_card = draw_card(drawn_cards)
        if not prize_card:
            break  # Exit the loop if no cards left
        print(f"The prize card for this round is the {prize_card} of diamonds.")

        # User makes a bid
        user = user_bid(user_bids)

        # Bot makes a bid based on the drawn card
        bot = make_bot_bid(prize_card)

        print(f"The bot bids: {bot}")

        # Determine the winner of the round
        winner = determine_winner(user, bot, prize_card)

        # Update points based on the winner
        if winner == "user":
            print("You win this round!")
            user_points += card_points[prize_card]
        elif winner == "bot":
            print("The bot wins this round!")
            bot_points += card_points[prize_card]
        else:
            print("It's a tie for this round!")
            user_points += card_points[prize_card] / 2
            bot_points += card_points[prize_card] / 2

    # Print final scores
    print("\nGame Over!")
    print(f"\nYour total points: {user_points}")
    print(f"Bot's total points: {bot_points}")

    if user_points > bot_points:
        print("Congratulations! You win!")
    elif user_points < bot_points:
        print("Sorry! The bot wins!")
    else:
        print("It's a tie!")

# Call the function to start the game
play_game()

```

In this version, the bot simply makes its bid based on the value of the drawn diamond card without considering the user's previous bids. Let's play the game and see how it performs!

In this keep track of the bids made my bot. Once a bid has been made it cant be made again.

Sure, I'll update the code to keep track of the bids made by the bot and ensure that it doesn't repeat the same bid in subsequent rounds. Here's the modified code:

```python
pythonCopy code
import random

# Dictionary to store the points for each card

    if available_cards:
        card = random.choice(available_cards)
        drawn_cards.append(card)
        return card
    else:
        print("No more cards left!")
        return None

# Function for user to make a bid

    if bot_bid in bot_bids:
        return make_bot_bid(bot_bids, drawn_card)  # Rebid if the chosen bid has been used before
    else:

        return bot_bid

# Function to determine the winner of the round

    print("Let's play the Diamonds game!")

    for round_num in range(1, rounds + 1):
        print(f"\nRound {round_num}:")

        # Draw a random diamond card
        prize_card = draw_card(drawn_cards)

        user = user_bid(user_bids)

        # Bot makes a bid based on the drawn card
        bot = make_bot_bid(bot_bids, prize_card)

        print(f"The bot bids: {bot}")

        # Determine the winner of the round
        winner = determine_winner(user, bot, prize_card)

        # Update points based on the winner
        if winner == "user":
            print("You win this round!")
            user_points += card_points[prize_card]
        elif winner == "bot":
            print("The bot wins this round!")
            bot_points += card_points[prize_card]
        else:

Now, the bot won't repeat its bids in subsequent rounds, ensuring a fair game. Let's give it a try and see how it performs!
